# Task

Modify `style.css` until you have the two divs with a class of `column` side by side. In other words, _only_ touching the CSS, turn the page into a two-column layout. See screenshot.png for the expectedd result.


# Bonus
Once you've done so, see if you can add a navigation menu to the side. Here are somethings you may need in order to accomplish this:
	- each section will need an id
	- your navigation menu will need anchors to the above ids
	- you may need to add other structure or use the `wrap` property to get the navigation menu to the side
	- try to accomplish this only using flex properties -- *no* floats
